## Overview

**ProjectForge AI** is an intelligent engineering copilot designed to bridge the gap between "Ideation" and "Execution."

For students and developers, the hardest part of building software isn't the coding—it's the planning. ProjectForge solves "blank canvas paralysis" by using **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** to:

1.  **Validate** idea uniqueness against real-world data.
2.  **Architect** the perfect tech stack.
3.  **Plan** the development lifecycle with curated tutorials.
4.  **Prepare** students for their final viva defense.
